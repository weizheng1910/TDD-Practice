# FooBarQix Kata

## Usage

- Clone this repository and run `npm install`
- Run tests with `npm run test` or `npm t`

## Instructions

Write an app that takes one number as input and returns a string as output:

```javascript
fooBarQix.compute(1);
// returns "1"
```

However, if the number follows one of the rules below, then return a word instead. For example, **numbers that are divisible by 3 but do not contain 3 return "Foo":**

```javascript
fooBarQix.compute(6);
// returns "Foo"
```

Write your app following the [TDD development lifecycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development#Test-driven_development_cycle) to ensure good code quality. Your app is considered completed once it has implemented **all** the rules stated below.

## Rules

- If the number is divisible by 3 or contains 3, return "Foo" instead of 3

  ```javascript
  fooBarQix.compute(6);
  // returns "Foo" as 6 is divisible by 3

  fooBarQix.compute(13);
  // returns "Foo" as 13 contains 3
  ```

- If the number is divisible by 5 or contains 5, return "Bar" instead of 5
  ```javascript
  fooBarQix.compute(10);
  // returns "Bar" as 10 is divisible by 5
  ```
- If the number is divisible by 7 or contains 7, return "Qix" instead of 7

  ```javascript
  fooBarQix.compute(14);
  // returns "Qix" as 14 is divisible by 7

  fooBarQix.compute(17);
  // returns "Qix" as 17 contains 7
  ```

- More than one rule can apply at the same time
  ```javascript
  fooBarQix.compute(15);
  // returns "FooBarBar" as 15 is divisible by 3, is divisible by 5, and contains 5
  ```
- Prioritize the "divisor" rule over the "contains" rule
  ```javascript
  fooBarQix.compute(51);
  // returns "FooBar" as 51 is divisible by 3 and contains 5
  ```

## Recommended Order of Tests

Remember that when practicing TDD, **you should always start with the simplest test first**. Here is a list of tests I recommend that you start with:

1. Return "1" when the input is 1
2. Return "Foo" when the input is divisible by 3 but does not contain 3 (i.e. input is 6)
3. Return "Bar" when the input is divisible by 5 but does not contain 5 (i.e. input is 10)
4. Return "Qix" when the input is divisible by 7 but does not contain 7 (i.e. input is 14)
5. Return "FooBar" when the input is divisible by 3 and 5 but does not contain either number (i.e. input is 60)
6. Return "FooQix" when the input is divisible by 3 and 7 but does not contain either number (i.e. input is 21)
7. Return "BarQix" when the input is divisible by 5 and 7 but does not contain either number (i.e. input is 140)

You should be able to figure out the rest of the tests on your own!
